Astrée , rencontres astrales have been designed for  the needs of the  checkpoint 4 (the last)  during our remote trainee session at the Wild Code School.
it has been fully designed, produced, coded by my own using React, Node, Express  Tailwind, Bulma. It contains a proper back-end , with databases , designed with Workbench and MYSQL.
The website is responsive only for the desktop and tablet breakpoints , due to a lack of time.
I will update it  and keep working on it on the coming months.











<h1 align="center">Wireframe</h1>


It has been done with  the help of Uizard ( an app really similar to Figma) but for this project i decided to change and  get used with another one.
You can access the wireframe and play the prototype with the following link : https://app.uizard.io/p/7d904e96
